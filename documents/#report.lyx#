Youth soccer leagues can be difficult to organize when you have kids of
 varying skill, age, etc.
 The

 builds teams according to specific criteria, and organizes the given data
 in an intuitive way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Functionality Provided
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Teams are created with skill level in mind.
 Players are ranked on a scale of 0-4.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Players are assigned a team based on age range, with the following ranges
 available: 8-9, 10-11, 12-13, 14-15, and 16-18.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Functionality Not Provided
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The addresses of the players are not tracked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Proximity of players' addresses does not influence team creation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Model Creation (SubSection)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Signatures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following signatures are defined in our model: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Name: represents the name of a Person.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Birthdate: the birth date of a Player.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
AgeRange: each Player is mapped to an age range.
 Teams must be made up of Players within the same range.
 Declared with 
\emph on
enum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Rank: the skill of a Player.
 Teams are made up of Players of the same rank.
 Declared with 
\emph on
enum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Gender: each Person has a gender (MALE or FEMALE).
 Declared with 
\emph on
enum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Person: the overarching person signature.
 Declared as 
\emph on
abstract
\emph default
 because both the Player and Guardian signatures need Name and Gender fields.
 And they are logical extensions of Person.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Guardian: represents the Player's legal guardian.
 Extends Person.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Player: extends Person.
 Adds additional fields that you'd expect a player to have, like rank and
 age range.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
MalePlayer: extends Player.
 A specific atom type for males.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
FemalePlayer: extends Player.
 A specific atom type for females.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Team: contains sets of male and female players, and the age range and rank
 that players in the team should be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Identify abstractions you want to have in your Alloy model and declare them
 as signatures, denoted with the 
\series bold
sig
\series default
 keyword.

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Determine which signatures should be declared as 
\series bold
abstract sig
\series default
, and explain why (

)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Specify the 
\series bold
relations 
\series default
between the signatures (i.e., abstractions) you have defined.
 (

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use set multiplicities to define the

multiplicity

 of each signature participating in a relation (

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In each step of your model creation, visualize your model with Alloy to
 see if you have created what you want (
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Try to check your expectations using 
\series bold
assertions
\series default
.
 If assertions fail, then visualize your counterexamples in a small scope.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsection
Scope-Based Model Checking (SubSection)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this part of your project, you have to do the following steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Define at least two facts that should always be true in your model.
 Argue why you should not specify them as assertions (
\emph on
20 points
\emph default
)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Specify at least two assertion that you expect to be true.
 If the assertions fail.
 please visualize the counterexamples and try to fix your model so the assertion
s hold (
\emph on
20 points
\emph default
)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Define at least two functions that are reused in your facts/assertions (
\emph on
10 points
\emph default
)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Define at least two predicates and illustrate how you have reused them in
 your model.
 (
\emph on
10 points
\emph default
)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Check your model for 5 scopes incrementally.
 (
\emph on
20 points
\emph default
)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Is there a case where your model holds for small scopes but false for larger
 ones?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How about the other way around?
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
If so, please figure out why that happens 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
You should document all the above steps in a written report (
\emph on
20 points
\emph default
)
