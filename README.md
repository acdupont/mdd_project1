CS 4710 - Project 1
===================

Team Creator
------------

Create teams given a pool of co-ed players.


The age groups for teams are 8-9, 10-11, 12-13, 14-15, and 16-18.

Possible requirements:
- Players would be assigned a value from 0-4 so the program can make "even" teams.
- - Players without a ranking would be given a ranking of 0.
- Each team would have the same number of girls within 1 (if one team had 3 girls, the other teams would have 2 or 3 girls).
- Each team would have the same number of boys within 1 (if one team had 8 boys, the other teams would have 8 or 9 boys).
- The program would take the address of the players into consideration (it would try to keep players who live close to each other on the same team).
